<h3 id="whatis">What is Test Pilot?</h3>

<p>Test Pilot is a open source user research program. As a Test Pilot, you'd be helping us to improve Mozilla products, both existing ones like Firefox and those that are still in development. Our overarching goal is to help the open source community grow knowledge on how people use the Web and provide best tools and services for them. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>

<h3 id="howto">How do I become a Test Pilot?</h3>

<p>If you are a user of Firefox version 3.5 or above, you just need to download and install the Test Pilot add-on. Once you've installed the add-on, you will automatically become a Test Pilot.  The add-on will then present you with any surveys or studies that we are running.</p>

<p>You can also uninstall the add-on at anytime if you don't want to continue flying with us. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>

<h3 id="whatdo">What do I need to do after I become a Test Pilot?</h3>

<p>Once or twice a month you will receive a new test case - either a study, a survey, or both - through Test Pilot.  Each one of these test cases explores one interesting topic or tests one new prototype idea for Firefox or another Mozilla product.</p>

<p>Studies automatically log data while you use Firefox.  At the end of the study, you will be prompted to submit your log data and/or survey answers.  Before you submit anything, you will always have the chance to view exactly what data has been collected.</p>

<p>You can choose not to submit the data if you are not comfortable. Also, you can quit a study anytime before you submit the data. 
You will also be able to see the list of studies and surveys you have participated in, as well as results and all anonymous data in a aggregated form for the study when it is complete.</p>

<p>If the test requires you to install a new feature or product, or would make any changes to your user interface, the platform will ask for your permission first. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>

<h3 id="whatsthe">What's the time commitment?</h3>

<p>These studies will need almost no extra time from you.  Mostly you'll just keep using Firefox as you normally do, while Test Pilot logs data. You may want to spend a couple of minutes to review your data before submission.  But you can also skip this step. It's up to you.</p>

<p>In the case of a survey, answering all questions should never take more than 15 minutes and will usually take much less time than that. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>

<h3 id="whatwill">What will happen to my submissions?</h3>

<p>We won't collect any personally identifiable information from you, such as your name, phone number, email address, etc. We also make sure that no study data is personally identifiable.</p>

<p>Each study will tell you what data is being collected.  Our general policy is not to collect any URLs or IP addresses that would identify what websites you visit.</p>

<p>All of your study data will be submitted anonymously and aggregated together with the data from other users. We will analyze study data only for the purposes of helping improve our products, and growing user knowledge in the open source community (in accordance with Test Pilot privacy policy).  After a study is complete, we will also publish sanitized and aggregated data under the Creative Commons Attribution License, as public resources. Everyone is encouraged to make creative use of it. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>

<h3 id="spam">Are you going to send me spam?</h3>

<p>No. Since we do not have any personal information like your email, phone number or address, the only communication channel we use is the add-on. We will use it only to notify you when a study starts and finishes. We don't plan to spam you in any way and you can always uninstall the add-on at any time. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>

<h3 id="quit">How do I quit a study or the entire program?</h3>

<p>We offer two ways for you to stop participating in Test Pilot studies:
<ur>
<li> To quit a on-going study: You can open the study status page through the "more info" link located under each study, then you can click "quit the study" to delete your data from your local computer. If you have already submitted your data to Mozilla, there is no way to withdraw your submission.</li>
<li> To disable the entire Test Pilot program: You can go to Firefox Tools menu, and disable or uninstall the Test Pilot program from the Add-on manager.</li> </p></ur>

<p>You are able to quit a study or the entire program at any time. However, we are very sorry if you want to stop the participation. If there is anything we can improve, please don't hesitate to let us know. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>


<h3 id="whowill">Who will analyze test data?</h3>

<p>Mozilla community members will help analyze study data, and you are welcome to do so too!</p>

<p>Data is so much fun! There are so many ways to read it. By bringing your own perspective to the data, you may help us find new insights or flaws in existing analysis.  We are always excited to hear about new ways of interpreting the data and are happy to start a discussion about them any time.  We can even revise and re-run a study if someone thinks of additional data that would be illuminating to collect. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>

<h3 id="contribute">How do I contribute to data analysis?</h3>

<p>You can either start your own analysis or comment on our analysis.</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to dig new meanings out of existing data for a specific test case, please share with us how you mined the data and what you learned. Visualizing your findings as an image is always an effective way to make people understand your work. You can also share your code with the community so we can learn from it or review how you drew the conclusion.</p>

<p>When you finish your analysis, you can submit it to our website, no registration required. You can also post a link to analysis hosted on your own website if you prefer. <a href="#top">Back to top of page</a></p>
