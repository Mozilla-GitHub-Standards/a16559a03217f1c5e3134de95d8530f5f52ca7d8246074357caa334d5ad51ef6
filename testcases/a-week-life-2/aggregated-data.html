			<h3>How to read the data</h3>
                 <p>There are two ways to work with this data sample: you can download the SQLite database, which consists of 3 tables, or if you are more comfortable working with .csv's, you can download the <a href="witl.tar.gz">witl.tar.gz</a> file, which contains the same 3 tables as separate .csv's. See below for a description of the tables and their columns.
</p>

<h4>Table Name: 'users'</h4>

<p>Main table of users and the metadata associated with each user. Note: 'user_id' is consistent over all tables - tables can by merged by/on 'user_id'</p>

<table class="callout">
  <tr><td><span class="headers">Column Name</span></td>
      <td><span class="headers">Explanation</span></td></tr>
<tr><td>user_id</td><td>All rows that have the same user number came from the same submission. Each submission is assumed to be a different user, but there are various ways that a single user could make multiple submissions (e.g. multiple computers, multiple Firefox profiles, etc.) These user numbers have no meaning or correlation to anything outside of the aggregated data file in which they appear. Their order has been randomized, so the numbers do not correspond to the order in which submissions were received.</td></tr>
<tr><td>fx_version</td><td>Firefox Version</td></tr>
<tr><td>os</td><td>OS Version</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Table Name: 'events'</h4>
<p>Main table of users and recorded events.</p>

<table class="callout">

<tr><td>user_id</td><td>See 'users' table'</td></tr>
<tr><td>event_code</td><td>Integer defining what the event was; see below for a description of these event codes.</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>BROWSER_ACTIVATE</td><td>Recorded when the browser returns to active use after going idle.</td><td>'data1' column identifies the mechanism used to detect activation (basically debugging info): "Self-ping timer" or "IdleService observer".</td></tr>

<tr><td>5</td><td>BROWSER_INACTIVE</td><td>Recorded when we detect that the browser has gone idle, either through the self-ping timer (study pings itself every five minutes while firefox is active) or through the IdleService observer (which triggers after ten minutes of Firefox being idle).</td><td>Data1 column says either "Self-ping timer" or "IdleService observer".</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td>BOOKMARK_STATUS</td><td>Recorded on app startup.</td><td>'data1' is the total number of bookmarks found. 'data2' is the total number of bookmark folders. 'data3' is the maximum depth of bookmark folders.</td></tr>

<tr><td>9</td><td>BOOKMARK_CREATE</td><td>Recorded when user creates a new bookmark OR a new bookmark folder. Ignores Livemark folders and does not trigger when a bookmark is created in one of these.</td><td>'data1' is either "New Bookmark Added" or "New Bookmark Folder".</td></tr>

<tr><td>10</td><td>BOOKMARK_CHOOSE</td><td>Recorded when user chooses a bookmark.</td><td>No additional data.</td></tr>

<tr><td>11</td><td>BOOKMARK_MODIFY</td><td>Recorded when user deletes a bookmark or moves it to a different folder. Ignores Livemark folders.</td><td>Data1 is either "Bookmark Removed" or "Bookmark Moved".</td></tr>

<tr><td>12</td><td>DOWNLOAD</td><td>Recored when a download completes.</td><td>No additional data.</td></tr>

<tr><td>17</td><td>PRIVATE_ON</td><td>Recorded when user enters private browsing mode. When in private browsing mode, no further recording is done.</td><td>No additional data. </td></tr>

<tr><td>18</td><td>PRIVATE_OFF</td><td>Recorded when user exits private browsing mode.</td><td>No additional data.</td></tr>

<tr><td>19</td><td>MEMORY_USAGE</td><td>Memory usage is recorded once every 15 minutes (although this was originally set to 1hr so data prior to Nov 6 will be 1 hour intervals), and upon startup. When memory usage is recorded, it will iterate through all the reporters in the memory manager, recording a MEMORY_USAGE event for each reporter.</td><td>'data1' contains the reporter path, and 'data2' contains the amount of memory used, in bytes.</td></tr>

<tr><td>20</td><td>SESSION_ON_RESTORE</td><td>Recorded on application startup, when session restore triggers.</td><td>'data1' is the number of windows restored, 'data2' is the number of tabs restored across all windows. If no session restore occurs, will record 0 for both columns.</td></tr>

<tr><td>22</td><td>PLUGIN_VERSION</td><td>On experiment startup, experiment records one PLUGIN_VERSION event for each plugin.</td><td>'data1' is plugin filename, 'data2' is plugin version, 'data3' is plugin name.</td></tr>

<tr><td>23</td><td>HISTORY_STATUS</td><td>Recorded on experiment startup.</td><td>'data1' is the total number of distinct places in the Places database, i.e. history items.</td></tr>

<tr><td>24</td><td>PROFILE_AGE</td><td>Recorded on experiment startup.</td><td>'data1' is the age (as a timestamp) of the oldest file in the profile directory. (Using the last-modified date, since creation date is not always available)</td></tr>

<tr><td>25</td><td>SESSION_RESTORE_PREFERENCES</td><td>On experiment startup, recorded once for each preference relevant to session restore.</td><td>'data1' is name of the pref, 'data2' is the value. Recorded prefs are browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash, .resume_session_once, and .max_resumed_crashes.</td></tr>

<tr><td>26</td><td>NUM_TABS</td><td>Recorded whenever memory is recorded (at startup and every 15 minutes) and also whenever a window or tab is opened or closed.</td><td>'data1' is number of windows, 'data2' is number of tabs (including the one just opened).</td></tr>

<tr><td>27</td><td>STARTUP_TIME</td><td>Recorded on startup. Will be used in the future to record time taken for Firefox to start up; however this data is not yet available.</td></tr>

<h4>Table name: 'survey'</h4>
<p>Table of users and associated Beta Background Survey answers.  For each row, the first column is 'user_id' and each of the following 14 columns represent the 14 survey questions. Answer choices are coded to integers, so for a given question, '0' represents the first answer choice, '1' corresponds to the second answer choice, and so on.  Answers to questions where multiple choices can be selected are pipe delimited.  See here for the survey questions and please note that because the survey was optional, the table does not include all users.</p>

<h3>Filtered Extensions</h3>

The following extensions are known to cause major changes to the relationship between tab use and memory in Firefox.  Data submissions from users who had one of these extensions installed have been filtered out of the data sets provided on this page, to ensure that the data sets are as representative as possible of default Firefox behavior:
