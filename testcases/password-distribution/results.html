			<h1>Accounts and Passwords Study: Analysis</h1>
		        <p>We all login to various websites everyday either on our own computers or on other computers. Remembering which username/password combination to use on a given site can be very frustrating.Â </br>

		        How do we manage our accounts and passwords currently? These are some analysis from <a href="https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/testcases/account-password.html">Accounts and Passwords Study</a>. The graphs on this page are based on the data submissions we received from 7823 Test Pilots running Firefox versions 3.5 and above, between Dec 15 and Jan 7, 2009.</p>
		  	<p>Contents:</p>
			<ol><li><a href="#sharecomputer">Do people share their computer?</a></li>
			  <li><a href="#passwordcount">How many passwords do people use?</a></li>
			  <li><a href="#feelhappy">How happy do people feel with current ways of managing accounts and passwords?</a></li>
			  <li><a href="#repeat">Do people repeat the same password on different sites?</a></li>
			</ol>
		
                         <p> These analysis are generated based on early raw data, and they may not be super definitive or representative for all Firefox users. We are looking for help to firm them up! Please join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla-labs-testpilot"> Test Pilot discussion group </a>if you have any suggestions or questions. </p>
		       	 <p> Also, if you would like to do your own analysis of the data from this study, you can <a href="https://testpilot.mozillalabs.com/testcases/password-distribution/aggregated-data.html">download samples of it here</a>.</br>

		  <p>Most people, as demostrated on the left side of the above graph, repeat their passwords on different sites. From this study, we also identified an interesting group of users  (about 8.5% of total Firefox password manager user) that stored one unique password for each site. These users mainly have fewer than 6 passwords in total, as shown below. What does it tell us? </p>
