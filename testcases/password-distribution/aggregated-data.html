			<h3>How to read the data</h3>
                 <p>Data is in CSV format.  The first line of the file is the header and gives the names of all the columns.   After that, each line contains a summary of the data for a single user.  Here are the column names and the explanation of each one:</p>


<table class="callout">
  <tr><td><span class="headers">Column Name</span></td>
      <td><span class="headers">Explanation</span></td></tr>

<tr><td>happiness</td><td>Answer to survey question "How do you feel about your current options for managing accounts and passwords?". 1 is the most frustrated, 5 is the happiest.</td></tr>
<tr><td>open_id</td><td>Answer to the survey question "Do you use OpenID?" (See below for response codes)</td></tr>
<tr><td>other_tools</td><td>Answer to survey question "Do you use other tools to help manage your password?" (See below for response codes).</td></tr>
<tr><td>multi_accounts_same_website</td><td>Answer to the question "Do you ever usemultiple accounts for the same wesite?" (See below for response codes)</td></tr>
<tr><td>share_computer</td><td>Answer to the question "Do you share your computer with others?" (See below for response codes)</td></tr>

<tr><td>histogram</td><td>semicolon-separated list of numbers, where each number is a number of sites that have the same password.  Sorted from highest to lowest. The highest number in histogram is equal to most_used, and the number of items in histogram is equal to total_passwords.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The survey questions are mutiple-choice, so the value in those columns will be a numerical answer code.  To interpret those codes, use the table below. The questions are on the left side and the answer codes are on the top.  (Some questions allow multiple responses.  If multiple responses were given, the answer codes will be delimited with semicolons.)</p>
